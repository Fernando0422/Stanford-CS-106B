Warmup
-------
Q1. How do the values of the member variables of `allBalls[0]` change from iteration to iteration? Specifically, what happens to the values of `_id`, `_x`, and `_y`?
A1. The values of _id, _x, and _y changed everytime i clicked continue by increasing or decreasing every time.

Q2. How do the values of the member variables of the stuck ball change from iteration to iteration? Contrast this to your answer to the previous question. Specifically, how are `_x`, and `_y` changing?
A2. TODO

Q3. After forcing the stuck ball to position (0, 0), does the ball move normally from there or does it stay stuck?
A3. TODO

Q4: What bug was causing certain balls to become stuck?
A4: TODO

Q5. On your system, what is the observed consequence of these memory errors:
- access an index outside the allocated array bounds?
- delete same memory twice?
- access memory after it has been deleted?
A5. TODO

PQArray
-------
Q6. There are extensive comments in both the interface (`pqarray.h`) and implementation (`pqarray.cpp`). Explain how and why the comments in the interface differ from those in the implementation. Consider both the content and audience for the documentation.
A6. TODO

Q7. The class declares member variables `_numAllocated` and `_numFilled`. What is the difference between these two counts and why are both needed?
A7. TODO

Q8. Give the results from your time trials and explain how they support your prediction for the Big-O runtimes of `enqueue` and `dequeue`.
A8. TODO

PQ Client
---------
Q9. Based on the Big O of `enqueue`/`dequeue`, what do you expect for the Big O of `pqSort` if using a `PQArray`? Run some timing trials to confirm your prediction, and include that data in your answer.
A9. TODO

Q10. Based on the Big O of `enqueue`/`dequeue`, what do you expect for the Big O of `topK` in terms of `k` and `n` if using a `PQArray`? Run some timing trials to confirm your prediction, and include that data in your answer.
A10. TODO

PQHeap
------
Q11. Start with an empty binary heap and enqueue the nine `DataPoint`s in the order shown below and show the result. You only need to show the final heap, not intermediate steps. Draw the heap as tree-like diagram with root element on top, its two children below, and so on. Yes, we know that we're asking you to draw pictures in a text file (we love the [AsciiFlow](http://asciiflow.com/) tool for "drawing" in text).
A11. TODO

Q12. Make two calls to `dequeue` on the above binary heap and draw the updated result.
A12. TODO

Q13. Draw the array representation of the binary heap above. Label each element with its array index.
A13. TODO

Q14. Re-run the timing trials on `pqclient.cpp` and provide your results that confirm that `pqSort` runs in time O(NlogN) and `topK` in O(NlogK).
A14. TODO

Embedded Ethics
---------------
Q15. Different institutions consider different factors in admissions and convert criteria to numbers in different ways.  Regardless of which specific factors are considered, should an admissions department use a purely numerical rankings based system? Why or why not?

If yes, discuss what factors you think would be best to include when calculating numerical rankings and why those factors are well-represented as numbers. If not, discuss what factors you think should be considered in college admissions that would be difficult to represent as a numerical score. There are no right or wrong answers here - we're genuinely interested in your thoughts!
A15. TODO

Q16. Describe a real-world system that requires ranking but in which classification with a single number misses important context (i.e. a priority queue might not be the best way to store the objects being ranked). Make sure to use an example that hasn't already been discussed in lecture or in this assignment.
A16. TODO

Q17. How would you design an implementation for the hospital's priority queue that dynamically determines which patient is the best match whenever a new organ becomes available? __Note:__ Your design does not have to be the fastest or most efficient.
A17. TODO
